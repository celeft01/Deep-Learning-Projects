## Content
- **Ex2**: Building and training a Convolutional Neural Network to classify the Fashion MNIST dataset, and using reesidual connections (ResNet) to the model.
- **Ex3**: Implementing a Recurrent Neural Network to perform sentiment analysis on the IMDB movie reviews dataset | Implementing a LSTM network for time series prediction using the Reuters Newswire dataset.
- **Ex4**: Training a VGG16 model from scratch on the CIFAR-100 dataset, using the pre-trained VGG16 model (trained on ImageNet) and fine-tuneing it on the CIFAR-100 dataset and using Early Stopping.
- **Ex5**:  Training an autoencoder on the MNIST dataset and visualizing its ability to reconstruct images | Comparing the performance of the autoencoder with PCA for dimensionality reduction.
